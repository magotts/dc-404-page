<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

Hi everyone! You can check out the live demo by clicking the Demo on top.
By creating more HTML and CSS websites, I didn't have a hard time creating the 404 page. It's my first time to use Figma. It's very convenient when it comes to figuring out what font/color/size the text is using.

I've learned that it is very important to be detailed. This page uses 3 fonts. If I hadn't check Figma, I wouldn't have known.

Keep on practicing until you are comfortable. :)
